    appended claude_desktop_config.json with : 
        {
        "mcpServers": {
            "mcp-server-demo": {
                "command": "C:\\Users\\ABC\\.local\\bin\\uv",
                "args": [
                    "--directory",
                    "C:\\Users\\ABC\\mcp-server-demo",
                    "run",
                    "main.py"
                ]
